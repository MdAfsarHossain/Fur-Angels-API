# Project Name:
### [Fur Angels Haven]()

# Short description of the project:
Fur Angels Haven is a responsive pet adoption website featuring a Navbar, Banner, Categories, Pets Display, and Footer section. The site dynamically displays all pet categories fetched from an API, allowing users to filter pets by category. Each pet card displays key details such as image, name, breed, birth, gender, price, pet details, and vaccination status. Users can like pets, view their details, and adopt them through a modal confirmation with a countdown. After adopting a pet, users cannot adopt the same pet again, and the Adopt button is disabled. The website adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
